Who writes our stories? In katharis.lol STERNA | PAU and I developed a text-only theatrical experience online: to be a participant means to co-write a story with your fellow participants. You can talk to them "backstage" and perform "onstage". Who is where and when is decided by an ex-machina bot that occasionally intervenes. "Backstage" is only accessible to your peer group, "onstage" is publicly visible to everyone. But all in text, and at the end a new story is born.

Technically it's a dockerized micro-service setup using the MEVN stack. You can find the code here https://github.com/lislis/katharsis.lol/

I took the online version down because the server was no longer being paid for by our grants 🙃
