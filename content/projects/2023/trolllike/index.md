The second part of the "21st century hauntings" trilogy, trolllike, looks at the mythical figure of the troll and its new incarnation, the internet troll.

The performers are on a journey through Norway, home of the trolls, when they meet the internet trolls. At first it's funny but quickly spirals into serious political issues from there, until Ragnarök, the apocalypse, hits.

Technically, it's a website visualizing an archive STERNA | PAU and I created for this piece. The frondend uses [a-frame](https://aframe.io/) to put the contents into a low-poly, 3D environment, that young audiences responded well to.

One pferformer navigates the site live on stage on an iPad, which is live streamed and then projected as the scenography.


The site is still live! https://trolllike.de/#/

I worked on this piece together with STERNA | PAU as part of my [media arts fellowship by the federal state NRW](https://www.medienwerk.nrw/en/projects/sterna-pau-lisa-passing-audience-participation-lab-2/).
