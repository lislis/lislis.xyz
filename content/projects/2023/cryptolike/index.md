The third and last part of the "21st century hauntings" trilogy, cryptolike, compares astrology and cryptocurrencies. Don't we all just want to be part of something bigger? A system that you can't quite explain, but you can trust. Or is it all make-believe?

The performers meet at MoonCon: one a crypto-bro, the other an astrology-girly. Will they find to each other through their similarities? Or are they just too different?

As part of the crypto-bro's conference workshop, the audience gets to play a small multiplayer game on their phones. Through a QR-code they get a big red button to press repeatedly, to the keep the crypto-hype (and the rocket on the big projection) going to the MOON!

Technically, it's a MEVN-stack game with websockets. The code and documentation lives here https://github.com/lislis/rocketclicker
